Implementation of matrices, for any dimensionality.

Matrix   : a general implementation for any dimensionality.
Matrix2D : a subclass to work with 2D matrices more easily.
Matrix3D : a subclass to work with 3D matrices more easily.
Matrix4D : a subclass to work with 4D matrices more easily.

Matrix2D, Matrix3D and Matrix4D have a text file format support allowing to dump and load them.

Header files containing the template classes are provided as well as a test suite. To build the tests, scripts for the software construction tool Scons are provided. Additionally, the tests require the Unittest++ testing library.
